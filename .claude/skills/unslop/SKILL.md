description: Anti-slop audit for AI-generated UI, bound to SuperClock. Use BEFORE designing or building any new face, kiosk view, or admin surface (constraints first), and AGAIN before calling it done (audit + fix). Also use when reviewing UI, when something "looks AI-generated", or when the user says slop, generic, or template-y.

# Unslop

Slop is the absence of decisions — an unguided model emits the statistical
median of its training data: indigo gradients, three-card grids,
glassmorphism, `#8884d8` charts, "Elevate Your Workflow". Four root causes:
**statistical gravity** (most-copied snippet wins), **decoration faking
hierarchy**, **fabrication pressure** (invented stats/testimonials/data), and
**per-emission amnesia** (values drift, components duplicate across
generations). Counter all four: decide once in the project's system, ban the
named defaults, require provenance, audit with counts — not vibes.

Portable origin: the `unslop` skill shared by Minimal-Design-System and
Super-AI-Components (research: 12 lenses, ~110 indicators, ~40 sources in
Minimal-Design-System's `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-anti-slop-rules.md`).
Phase 0 below rebinds it to this repo and holds every SuperClock amendment;
Phases 1–3 are the portable core, generated from me:unslop.

## Phase 0 — SuperClock's bindings

This repo has already decided, and these are law:

- **Two token systems, never mixed.** Kiosk surfaces consume the `@theme`
  tokens in `src/index.css` (`--color-accent`, the `--face-*` set); admin
  surfaces consume the shadcn semantic tokens scoped to `.admin-root` in
  `src/admin/index.css`. `npm run check:tokens` is the mechanical audit and
  joins Phase 2.
- **Faces respond to night mode through tokens.** Night is a `--face-*`
  palette flip, not per-face logic; a face must read the tokens and survive
  both palettes (legacy exceptions live in the token gate's exemption list,
  which may only shrink). The **one-accent-quantity rule** from the
  three-faces study holds: one saturated accent quantity per face.
- **The kiosk viewport is a 1080×1080 circle.** The kiosk responsive pass is
  "nothing load-bearing outside the disc" (corners are invisible on round
  devices), not 375px. The admin is phone-first: 375px applies there.
- **Ambient motion is content, not chrome.** Breathing, Fireplace, and clock
  hands are sanctioned idle animation because the animation IS the app.
  Chrome, overlays, and every admin surface animate only on state change.
  Active-aware effects: any `setInterval`/rAF gates on `props.isActive`.
- **Honest offline.** An app that fetches shows an explicit offline/stale
  tell (WeatherApp and GithubApp are the reference); rendering fallback or
  mock data as live is fabrication.
- **Pure `#000`/`#fff` is reserved for the night palette tokens** — never
  introduced ad hoc elsewhere.
- **lucide-react** is the only icon library; **Inter** is the only UI family
  (faces may carry their own display type as a designed decision, e.g.
  Strokes' junction-gap digits).
- Unimplemented schema options render **disabled with their schema-meta
  note** — never hidden, never silently broken.
- **Compose from what exists:** RoundList, StateRing, SchemaForm, and the
  shadcn primitives under `src/admin/components/ui/`.

**Exceptions to the core** (these override Phases 1–3):

- Effects: pure `#000`/`#fff` only through the night palette tokens, above.
- Motion: the ambient carve-out above. Scroll-reveal, marquee, typewriter and
  parallax stay banned everywhere; kiosk timers gate on `isActive`.
- Copy: fabrication includes fake device names, fake fleet health, and mock
  weather rendered as live.
- States: offline/stale is a fifth designed state, with its honest tell. AA
  contrast holds in BOTH the day and night palettes. Visible keyboard focus
  is an admin requirement.
- Responsive: the admin gets the 375px pass (no horizontal scroll, ≥24px tap
  targets, 44px in sticky bars, no hover-only actions, `dvh` not `vh`). The
  kiosk gets the circle-crop pass instead: nothing load-bearing outside the
  disc, arc gesture zones unobstructed.
- Counts: one saturated accent per face; that is the rule, not per viewport.
- Hostile fixtures add: offline, stale cache, empty playlist, 90-char device
  name.

**Mechanical audit.** `npm run check:tokens` (token contract), `npm run
check:rules` (the greps as records in `rules/superclock.json`:
gradients/glass, arbitrary `[Npx]`, `transition-all`, unbound `animate-`,
chart defaults, emoji in chrome, marketing copy, guarded nav cleanup,
isActive-gated timers, each with a severity, sanctioned exemptions and their
reasons; judgment rules print as unchecked, never as passed) and `npm test`
(registry coherence + contract + schema liveness + the rule ratchet) all
green. Raw `#hex|rgba?(|hsl(` outside `index.css` token blocks stays the
token gate's job (`SYS-1`, delegated).

**Extra fix rows** (these win over the core's rows of the same name):

| Violation | Substitute |
|---|---|
| Emoji/icon leak | lucide at its sizes, or nothing |
| Loops/scroll FX outside ambient apps | Bind to real state change or render static |
| Contrast fail | Move UP the ink/tone ramp or lighten surface; never a one-off darker hex |
| Mock data shown as live | Honest offline/stale tell (WeatherApp pattern); never a silent fallback |
| Timer ticking while inactive | Gate the effect on `props.isActive` |
| Face broken at night | Consume `--face-*`; never fork a night variant of the component |

## Phase 1: Constraints while generating

Universal hard bans (researched AI tells; any occurrence needs an explicit
justification, and an exception written in the repo's Phase 0 wins over this
list):

1. **Effects.** No gradient text (`bg-clip-text`), no gradients on controls
   or text, no indigo→violet gradient anywhere, no glassmorphism without real
   underlying content, no blurred orbs / spotlights / grain layers, no colored
   or glowing shadows, no pure #000/#fff pairs.
2. **Type.** Only the project's declared families and scale; no new fonts,
   ad-hoc sizes, or blanket `tracking-tight`; no italic-serif accent words;
   no caps eyebrow repeated per section; hierarchy = size/weight, never
   decoration.
3. **Layout.** Container nesting ≤1 (no cards in cards); separation ladder:
   spacing → hairline → surface tint → card; radii and gaps only from the
   project's scale; no exactly-3-equal-cards reflex; no identical stat-card
   strips; the screen's most important element visibly dominant. **Layout
   does not move on state change**: hover, focus and selection may change
   colour/shadow/ring/opacity, never padding, gap, size, border-width or
   type; space for anything conditional is reserved at rest (disclosure
   components are the declared exception).
4. **Components.** Compose from the project's library (search before
   creating; no V2 duplicates); no colored left-border accent strips; no
   "✨ AI-powered" badge theater; unlabeled sparkle icons never.
5. **Icons.** One library, one weight, 2–3 sizes; zero emoji in chrome.
6. **Motion.** Only on state change; no idle loops, scroll-reveal, marquee,
   typewriter, parallax; never `transition: all`; transform/opacity only;
   `prefers-reduced-motion` guard whenever keyframes exist.
7. **Copy.** Verb + object labels (never "Get Started"/"Learn More"); banned
   register: elevate/unlock/empower/seamless/effortless/supercharge,
   "not just X, it's Y", exclamation marks in microcopy; zero fabricated
   numbers, names, quotes, logos, or demo data no real system could emit.
8. **Charts.** Project palette only (never `#8884d8`/`#82ca9d`); linear/step
   interpolation; no gradient area fills; flat marks; units visible; bars
   zero-based; <4 data points is a stat, not a chart.
9. **States & a11y.** Empty/loading/error/populated all designed; anything
   that fetches also gets an honest offline/stale tell, never fallback or
   mock data rendered as live; visible focus on everything interactive; AA
   contrast on the actual surface, in every theme the project ships;
   semantic elements (no onClick divs); accessible names on icon buttons.
   **Chrome states count too**: every collapsed/compact/truncating mode a
   component declares is designed and checked, and truncation is decided for
   the tree, not per leaf.
10. **Responsive.** Verify at 375px: no horizontal scroll, ≥24px tap targets
    (44px in sticky bars), no hover-only actions, tables get a small-screen
    strategy, `dvh` not `vh` for shells.

## Phase 2: Audit before "done"

Audit what you changed. Older code that already breaks a rule is its own
scoped task; do not sweep it uninvited.

**Mechanical first.** If the project has a rule detector or token gate
(Phase 0 names it), run it and apply each hit's own `fix` rather than
inventing one. Do not re-grep what a gate already owns: greps run from
memory go stale, and two of this skill's own greps once sat broken for weeks
that way. Then work the detector's `unchecked` list, the rules no script can
run. They are reported so they cannot be forgotten, and most of them
discharge in the rendered passes below.

**Without a detector**, grep the changed files (expect zero, exceptions
justified), over the same roots the project's gate scans if it has one; a
grep list that disagrees with the gate's scope is where a violation
survives: `bg-gradient-|bg-clip-text|backdrop-blur` · raw
`#hex|rgba?(|hsl(` in components when a token system exists · arbitrary
`[Npx]` values · `transition-all|animate-` outside sanctioned loaders ·
`8884d8|82ca9d|strokeDasharray="3 3"` · emoji codepoints in chrome ·
`elevate|unlock|empower|supercharge|seamless|effortless` in copy.

Rendered passes: **squint** (one thing dominant, no identical section
anatomy) · **counts** (font sizes ≤7, radii/shadows ⊆ project scale, ≤1
saturated accent per viewport) · **contrast** (≥4.5:1, every theme) ·
**keyboard** (focus visible everywhere) · **375px** · **state stability**
(at rest, hovered, focused, selected: only colour/shadow/ring/opacity
differ, nothing reflows a neighbour) · **chrome states** (render every
collapsed/compact/truncating mode; a clipped focus ring still passes the
DOM, so this pass is a screenshot or it did not happen) · **hostile
fixtures** (3× strings, empty, error, offline, mixed-sign data) · **motion
at rest** (idle viewport: nothing animates outside genuine, state-bound
progress indicators) · **ratchet** (distinct radii/shadows/sizes did not
grow vs. before the change).

## Phase 3: Fix ladder

Never fix by bare deletion: slop is a **faked decision**. Find the job the
decoration was doing and do it with the system's device. A repo's Phase 0
may add rows, and where one names the same violation as a row here, the
repo's row wins.

| Violation | Substitute |
|---|---|
| Gradient fill/text | Flat token; emphasis via size/weight/position; one accent word max |
| Glass/glow/orbs | Delete layer; separate via spacing → hairline → tint → card |
| Colored/new shadow | Project elevation token; focus → focus ring; attention → hierarchy |
| Raw hex/px | The project's token (match by usage); none fits → propose it, don't inline |
| Off-scale value | Snap to the project's nearest scale step |
| New font/size/weight | Nearest declared style; emphasis = weight step, not new size |
| Emoji/icon leak | Project icon set at its sizes, or nothing |
| Loops/scroll FX | Bind to real state change or render static; named transitions, ease-out |
| Copy register | Verb + object; unprovable adjective/number → delete the claim |
| Chart defaults | Project palette, plain line, linear/step, add unit, direct labels |
| Contrast fail | Move UP the text ramp or lighten surface; never a one-off darker hex |
| Nested cards | Dissolve inner boundaries down the ladder, keep content |
| 3-card reflex/stat strip | Rank content; dominant cell for the answering item, rest → row/table |
| Happy-path only | Empty = sentence + creating action; loading = matched skeleton; error = cause + retry |
| Mock data shown as live | Honest offline/stale tell; never a silent fallback |
| Layout moves on a state | Reserve the space at rest (`invisible`/`opacity-0`, or the same border in `transparent`); put the signal on colour/shadow/ring/opacity |
| Collapsed state loses content | Design the collapsed mode as its own state; icons keep their labels as tooltips/accessible names |
| Indicator clipped by an ancestor | Draw it on the ancestor that owns the boundary, or lift the clip one level |
| 375px fails | Mobile-first bases, `dvh`, padded hit areas, kebab menus, table strategy |
| Duplicate component | Delete new one; extend existing via its variant props |
| Ratchet growth | Converge onto existing steps; new steps enter via the token system only |

Report as: violation → rule area → fix applied. Re-run Phase 2 until clean.
